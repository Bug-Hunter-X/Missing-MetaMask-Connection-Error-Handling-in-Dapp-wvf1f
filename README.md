# Missing MetaMask Connection Error Handling in Dapp

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dapps:  lack of robust error handling for MetaMask wallet connection. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides an improved version with better error handling.

The original code only checks for the existence of the `ethereum` object.  A more robust solution should also handle scenarios where the wallet is locked or the user has denied access.  This improved version provides a more user-friendly experience and prevents unexpected crashes.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or any HTML file that includes the JavaScript files) in your browser.
3. Observe the console output in both scenarios (buggy code and improved code).

## Issues Addressed

* Missing error handling for locked/disconnected MetaMask wallet.
* Lack of user guidance when the wallet connection fails.
